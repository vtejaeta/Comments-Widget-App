### Description: 
This is comments widget app made with Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. It has all  features like comment box, post comment, reply to comment, nested comments, edit comment, delete comment. I have also used local storage to persist state of the app. 

`To brush up skills on nested data addition, removal and editing, one must try to implement this app.`

### Features to be implemented
Login functionality to add comment,
addition of like and dislike comment,
integrating database with this app
